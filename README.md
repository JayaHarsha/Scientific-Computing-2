# Scientific-Computing-2

Scientific Computing 2 is an Graduate Level Course at University of Oklahoma.

Goal of this Course: 
Real world data comes in various shapes and forms. In this course we will concentrate on
mining, modeling and analysis of data that naturally arise sequentially in the form of a series,
known as time series - monthly unemployment numbers, monthly income tax collection, sea
surface temperature at a location, wind speed at a location (used in deciding to build a wind farm
or not), stock prices, to name a few. This course will introduce various tools from Probability
and Statistics, Estimation Theory and Prediction theory.
